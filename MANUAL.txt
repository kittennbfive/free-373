suffix _16 on variable means hex value

0x is optional on hex values

commands:

setq $n -> set MJPEG quality 1-100 (dez, worse to best - values under 45 give really poor results)

size get -> get picture size of incoming video

size set $w $h -> set picture size of encoder to $w $h - for testing only, if this does not match incoming video you will get garbage!

size auto -> set picture size of encoder according to incoming video

stream skip $n -> only send every $nth frame

stream start -> start streaming
stream stop -> stop streaming

mem r $sz $addr_16 -> read memory location ($z is 1 or 2 or 4 bytes)
mem w $sz $addr_16 $val_16 -> write memory location

i2c r $reg_16 -> read ITE-register $reg
i2c w $reg_16 $val_16 -> write ITE-register $reg with $val
